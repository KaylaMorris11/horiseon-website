An HTML website that is accessible and optimized

My motivation was to learn how to create a website that was accessible, neat, and performed at the best of it's ability.

The problems I solved were changing the divs to the proper semantic elements, added alt tags to all images and icons, and deleted anything unnecessary.

I learned that semantic elements and alt tags describing images and icons are necessary so that those with disabilities are also able to use the website.
